# Documentation Consolidated

All project documentation has been moved to **MultiplayerShooter/README.md** for better organization.

Please refer to:

- **MultiplayerShooter/README.md** - Complete project documentation, architecture, setup, and troubleshooting
- **presentation.md** - Talk slides and code examples for the .NET Conf 2025 presentation
- **speaker-notes.md** - Detailed presenter guide with timing, tips, and speaking notes

This keeps talk-related materials separate from project documentation.
